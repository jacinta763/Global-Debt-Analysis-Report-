## 🌍 Global Debt Analysis (1950–2022)

### 📌 **Project Summary**  
This project analyzes global debt trends from **1950 to 2022** using data from the **IMF Global Debt Database**. It explores how debt levels have evolved across **regions**, **income groups**, and **sectors**—including **government**, **corporate**, **household**, and **private debt**. The goal is to uncover key patterns, assess fiscal vulnerabilities, and provide actionable insights that support **data-driven policymaking** and **financial risk forecasting**.

### 🎯 **Objectives**
- Examine historical debt patterns by sector and region.  
- Identify periods of significant debt surges or declines.  
- Compare debt behavior across income groups and countries.  
- Provide interactive visualizations for dynamic exploration.  
- Offer insights to support fiscal and financial decision-making.  

### 📊 **Dataset Overview**  
  
- **Scope**: 190 economies, spanning **1950–2022**  
- **Variables**: Country, Region, Income Group, Debt Type (Central Government, General Government, Household, Non-financial Corporate, Private), and annual **Debt-to-GDP ratios**

### 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard development  
- **Power Query** – Data cleaning and unpivoting  
- **DAX** – Measures and calculated columns (e.g., YoY Growth, Averages, Decade grouping)  
 

### 📈 **Key Insights**
- **Global debt has grown steadily**, with sharp increases during **2008–09 (Financial Crisis)** and **2020–21 (COVID-19 pandemic)**.  
- **High-income countries** have consistently higher debt-to-GDP ratios, especially in the public sector.  
- **Private debt** in **middle-income economies** is rising rapidly, signaling potential future vulnerabilities.  
- **Asia-Pacific and North America** recorded the fastest increases in corporate and household debt respectively in recent decades.  
- Debt patterns differ across **income levels**, with trade-offs often seen between government and private sector debt.

### ✅ **Takeaways**
- Debt surveillance must account for **sectoral** and **regional** differences to be effective.  
- There is a need for proactive fiscal policies in **emerging economies** where private debt is surging.  
- **Interactive dashboards** like this provide a valuable tool for stakeholders to explore data and support **evidence-based policy development**.
